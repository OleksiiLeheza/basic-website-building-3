    <h2>History</h2>
    <p >Apple Inc. is a technology company that was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and
        Ronald Wayne. It is now one of the world's leading technology companies, specializing in consumer
        electronics, software development, and online services. Here is a brief history of the company</p>
    </p><br> 
 <p  >
    <h3  >Early Years (1976-1984)</h3>
    In a garage in Cupertino, California, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created the first Apple computer, the Apple
    I. They sold it as a DIY kit and later introduced the Apple II, which was the first personal computer to feature
    color graphics. Apple went public in 1980, generating significant revenue and becoming a major player in the
    emerging personal computer industry.</p> <br> 
 <p >
    <h3>Lisa and Macintosh Era (1984-1991)</h3>
    In 1984, Apple introduced the Macintosh, a groundbreaking computer with a graphical user interface and a mouse.
    It revolutionized the industry but faced internal struggles, leading to Jobs' departure in 1985. The following
    years saw the release of the Macintosh Portable and the Macintosh II, but Apple faced increasing competition and
    declining sales.</p> <br> 
    <p>
    <h3>Turbulent Times (1991-1997)</h3>
    Throughout the 1990s, Apple experienced various challenges, including leadership changes, declining market share,
    and unsuccessful product launches. However, in 1997, Apple acquired NeXT Computer, bringing Steve Jobs back to the
    company as an advisor.</p><br> 
 <p>
    <h3>Renaissance and the iPod (1998-2006)</h3>
    Jobs became Apple's interim CEO and initiated a significant turnaround. The iMac, released in 1998, became a
    design icon and revived Apple's fortunes. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, a portable digital music player
    that revolutionized the music industry. It was followed by iTunes, an online music store, which became immensely
    popular.</p> <br> 
    <p>
    <h3>The iPhone and iPad Era (2007-2010)</h3>
    In 2007, Apple launched the iPhone, a revolutionary smartphone that combined a mobile phone, an iPod, and
    internet communication capabilities. The iPhone's success transformed Apple into a dominant player in the mobile
    industry. In 2010, Apple released the iPad, creating a new product category of tablet computers.</p><br> 
  <p>
    <h3>Post-Steve Jobs Era (2011-2019)</h3>
    In 2011, Steve Jobs passed away, but his legacy continued to shape Apple's direction. The company maintained its
    focus on innovative product design and introduced new iterations of the iPhone, iPad, and MacBook. It also
    launched services like iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple Pay.</p><br> 
 <p>
    <h3>Recent Developments (2020-Present)</h3>
            Apple continued to expand its product lineup with the introduction of the Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.
            It
            also diversified into services with the launch of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. In 2020, Apple transitioned
            its
            Mac computers to custom-designed Apple Silicon chips, further integrating hardware and software
            capabilities.
